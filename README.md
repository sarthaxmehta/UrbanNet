# 🌍 UrbanNet  
### AI-Powered Satellite Building Detection & Urban Footprint Extraction System

UrbanNet is an end-to-end geospatial artificial intelligence pipeline designed for automated building footprint extraction from multispectral satellite imagery.

The system integrates cloud-based remote sensing, supervised machine learning, and deep learning–based semantic segmentation to enable scalable urban infrastructure analysis.

Developed using Sentinel-2 imagery (2023) over Delhi NCR, UrbanNet demonstrates how modern AI techniques can be fused with GIS workflows for high-resolution urban mapping and spatial analytics.

# 🚀 Project Overview

UrbanNet implements a multi-stage AI-driven geospatial workflow:

1. **Cloud-Based Multispectral Feature Engineering (Google Earth Engine)**
2. **Supervised Machine Learning Classification (Random Forest)**
3. **Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation (U-Net, PyTorch)**
4. **GIS-Based Spatial Analysis and Vectorization (QGIS)**

The system moves beyond traditional spectral thresholding by integrating:

- Spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, NDBI)
- Texture-based spatial features (GLCM)
- Ensemble classification
- Convolutional Neural Network segmentation

The result is a scalable and reproducible pipeline for automated urban building detection.
